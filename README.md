Customer 360 is a customer interaction management web application enabling businesses to manage customer details, track 
interactions across various channels and directions, and view a summary of recent communications. The application  is designed 
using Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an embedded SQLite database. It features a user-friendly interface for interaction 
tracking and includes Django's default administration panel for efficient data management and customization. The project was a part 
of a course I completed on Coursera.
